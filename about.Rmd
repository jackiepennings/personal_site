#Jacquelyn Pennings, Ph.D.  
  
  
  

I am proud to call East Nashville my home. It's the best neighborhood on the planet.

Yes there really is a Kalamazoo. It's where I'm from.

My degrees are from Belmont University (B.S.) and Texas Christian University (M.S. & Ph.D.). Go Horned Frogs!

I am currently a biostatistician at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. I also do statistical consulting work for Elite Research.


###I nerd out over:
* Renovating my home  
* Ice skating  
* The tv show Chuck  
* Traveling  
* Structural Equation Models  
* Lake Michigan  


My newest thing is ... Crossfit. Ouch.
