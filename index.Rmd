Welcome to my website. I am just beginning to work on the site so please bear with me!



My inspiration: *Yet this I call to mind and therefore I have hope: Because of the LORD's great love we are not consumed, for his compassions never fail. They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness. I say to myself, "The LORD is my portion; therefore I will wait for him."* -- Lamentations 3:21-24
